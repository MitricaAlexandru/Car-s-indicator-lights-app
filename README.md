# Cas`s indicator lights
I had to work on a project called "car's indicator lights", which was divided into three modes: 
The first mode was called the "lane change mode," and it was intended to operate as follows: When the push button was pressed for less than 500 ms, the left/right LED would blink three times.

The second mode was named the "normal mode," and it functioned as follows: When the left/right push button was pressed for more than 500 ms, it would continue blinking until the button was released.

The third mode was the "hazard mode." In this mode, when the hazard button was pressed for at least 200 ms, both LEDs had to blink, and the blinking would stop when the hazard button was pressed again.
