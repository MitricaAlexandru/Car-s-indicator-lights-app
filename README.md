# Indicator-Light-App
The project involves creating a signal simulator with three distinct modes of operation: "Change Lane Mode," "Normal Mode," and "Hazard Mode." These three modes had to be implemented on an Arduino Uno board to simulate a car's signaling using 2 LEDs, 3 push-buttons, resistors, and other components.
